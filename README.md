# Back-propagation-neural-network-matlab-version

---

A back propagation (BP) neutral network in Matlab

---

## Tutorial
This program uses Matlab to create and train a BP neural network.

Run this program by running the **main.m** file, which contains  the following steps:

1. Creation of training data;
2. Create and train a BP network;
3. Create new data tests;
4. Draw the results;
5. Save model parameters;
6. Load model parameters.

You can change the training set, number of neurons in the hidden layer, and number of training epochs in **main.m**, batch_sizeã€‚

The **BPNetwork.m** file contains the network structure, forward and backward propagation, and the learning rate can be modified in this file.
